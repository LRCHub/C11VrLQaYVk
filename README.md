[00:01.24] (One, two, three, hey!)
[00:12.74] 
[00:15.24] I gave her all the time that
[00:18.71] Was in the world
[00:21.65] I guess it wasn't enough
[00:24.88] For that girl
[00:27.73] She made me feel as though I
[00:30.96] Could be the one
[00:33.25] But it turns out that game of love
[00:36.90] Was just for fun
[00:44.90] 
[00:39.52] Now I don't wanna give you up that fast
[00:47.16] 'Cause you make it
[00:49.37] Feel like we could last, whoa-oh
[01:05.37] 
[00:52.55] You're always coming and goin', yeah
[00:55.76] You never really know just what you need
[01:00.80] You take things as you see, oh
[01:05.08] No, it's not amusing
[01:07.83] You always manage to send me in a twirl
[01:13.00] You're one confusing girl
[01:25.50] 
[01:19.27] Whoa, oh-whoa
[01:22.35] Whoa, oh-whoa
[01:25.52] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
[01:35.02] 
[01:29.70] 24-7, 365 in a year (five in a year)
[01:35.95] That's just how long it takes to
[01:39.01] Bring you near, oh-whoa-oh
[01:42.17] I just don't know how you are
[01:45.31] Still locked inside of my heart
[01:48.36] And I just can't bring myself to let you go
[01:52.78] Let you go
[01:57.78] 
[01:54.39] And I don't wanna give you up that fast
[02:01.27] 'Cause you make it
[02:03.50] Feel like we could last, whoa-oh
[02:19.50] 
[02:06.93] You're always coming and goin'
[02:09.91] Never really know just what you need, whoa-oh
[02:15.11] You take things as you see, oh
[02:19.58] No, it's not amusing
[02:22.41] You always manage to send me in a twirl
[02:27.55] You're one confused
[02:37.05] 
[02:30.55] Now I know the world don't spin around me
[02:37.45] But why won't she just make it clear to see
[02:46.55] If she is into me?
[02:48.18] If she is into me?
[02:57.18] 
[02:49.82] 'Cause you're always coming and goin'
[02:53.42] Never really know just what you need, whoa-oh (what you need)
[02:58.63] You take things as you seem, oh (take things as you see)
[03:02.78] No, it's not amusing
[03:05.63] You always manage to send me in a twirl
[03:10.70] You're one confusing girl
[03:23.20] 
[03:17.82] Oh, hey, hey, hey!
